# Davinci Resolve tools by Socratica

## Introduction
We are always looking for ways to streamline the process of video production.
After all, people are reluctant to fund the production of high-quality
educational content, so margins are very, very tight. We will do anything
to speed up or simplify the process. In this repository, we are sharing some
tools and scripts that we use automate the creation of videos in bulk.
We hope you find this useful!

## Scripting
We will be using the Python scripting API by Blackmagic Design in our tools.
While there is also a Lua API we do not know Lua, and believe that going forward
there will be a greater emphasis on using Python.
